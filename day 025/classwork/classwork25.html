    <h3>What is the Anime about?</h3>
    <h4>Naruto</h4>
    <p>The main character is Uzumaki/Namikaze Naruto, he's parent died at his birth<br>when giving him the most powerfull tailed beast the 9 tails</p>

    <p>The nine tails is one of the ten tailed beasts he lives inside of Naruto and gives him unlimited<br>chakra and powers throughout the series he gets more stronger and stronger</p>
    <p>Naruto is determined to get back his best friend Sasuke Uchiha and<br>along the way he slowly became the strongest<br>in all of his childhood he was hated and he always wanted to prove everyone wrong.</p>
    <h4>Sasuke</h4>
    <p>We can say that Sasuke Uchiha is the best Side character ever developed, with his powers<br>being on a similar level to narutos he's really interesing, just like Naruto Sasuke lost his parents<br>to his older brother Itachi who had gone rogue to save the village</p>
    <p>After that Sasuke went rogue and he became one of the strongest characters in all of Anime history.</p>

    <h2>Story Line</h2>
    <p>Two characters Sasuke and Naruto are in constant battle, the anime shows us<br>how their lifes proggress and really tells us that their<br>completly different and that is shown by the anime when Sasuke is Yin and Naruto is Yang<br>Yin is moon and Yang is sun in japanesse</p>
    <p>Narutos goal was to become Hokage witch he does eventually but it takes a lot of time bu he eventually does.</p>
    <p>As for Sasuke he becomes a shadow hokage feared by everyone, Basically they do become friends in the end.</p>
    <p>Throught the series there are lots of great side characters like Kakashi, Sakura, Jiraya and etc</p>
    <p>I would 100% recommend it.</p>
    <h2>Here is some extra information</h2>
    <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father's.</p>
